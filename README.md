## Data structures
The way data is arranged in memory;
We have the following structure for arrays:
- How many rows
- How many cols
- How many of those groups
```
E.g., String[2][2][2] arr = {
    {"000"}, {"100"},
    {"010"}, {"110"},
} 
```

## Algorithms
Steps we take to manipulate data;

### Linear search
Good for looking for multiple values in an array with repeated numbers;

### Binary search
Good for looking for single values in a not-duplicate array;
